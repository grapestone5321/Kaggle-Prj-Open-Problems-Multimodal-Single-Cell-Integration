## Goal of the Competition

The goal of this competition is to predict how DNA, RNA, and protein measurements co-vary in single cells as bone marrow stem cells develop into more mature blood cells. 

You will develop a model trained on a subset of 300,000-cell time course dataset of CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) from four human donors at five time points generated for this competition by Cellarity, a cell-centric drug creation company.
